// I'll use this file to illustrate on the input file format.
// The first thing you may notice is that
// you are free to add line comment with "// comments",
// similar format in C/Java, but not support block comment for now.
// The program was originally designed to compute
// the shortest path with given start point and end point in a simple polygon,
// and then show how many corners the path covers,
// but for now it only supports simple polygon triangulation.
// So the following three lines show how many corners( 0 ) the shortest path covers
// with the start point ( -3, 4 ) and the end point ( 5, 0 ).
// s
// 0
// e
// The next line is the start point and end point, separated by one whitespace.
// Since they are useless for the current implementation,
// so you can assign then with random numbers, like: 0 0 0 0
-3 4 5 0
// The next line is data defined the visualization area,
// it should be a square and fully covers all given points
10 10
// The next line is the number of vertices of your polygon
6
// The rest of file is the data of those vertices.
// Each line represents a vertex, with its x-coor and y-coor, separated by one whitespace.
// By the way, this file defines the polygon provided by the simple example in the select list
